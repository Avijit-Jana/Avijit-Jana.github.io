### **4. Microsoft : Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents**
 - **Description**: As a data scientist at Microsoft, I developed a machine learning model to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs). Utilizing the GUIDE dataset, I created a classification model that predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents (True Positive, Benign Positive, False Positive). This model leverages historical data and customer responses to provide SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations through a guided response system, ultimately improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.
- **Tech Stack**: 
    1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
    2. Machine Learning Classification Techniques
    3. Model Evaluation Metrics(Macro-F1 Score,Precision,Recall)
    4. Cybersecurity Concepts and Frameworks (MITREATT&CK)
    5. Handling Imbalanced Datasets
    6. Model Benchmarking and Optimization
- **Results**: Enabled users to visualize and explore data interactively.
